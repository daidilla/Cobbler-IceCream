    <h1>Items/Ingredients Needed</h1>
    <h3>Here is a list of ingredients needed to complete this recipe</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>8 fresh peaches
            The peaches being fresh is optional but in my opinion the recipe is the best with fresh peaches. You are welcome to use canned peaches or frozen peaches.
            If using frozen or canned peaches you would need approximately 4 cups of peaches. If using fresh peaches please peel, pit, and slice into wedges.
        </li></p>
        <li>1/2 cup of white sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of brown sugar</li>

        <li>1/8th teaspoon of ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of fresh lemon juice or bottled</li>
        <p>Again, fresh ingredients are optional but are the preference for the best turnout of this simple recipe.</p>

        <li>1 cup of all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of baking powder</li>

        <p>The butter for this recipe needs to be chilled and cut into thin, small pieces</p>

        <p>Toss the peaches in the bowl to coat evenly. Make sure all peaches are cover to the best of your ability. Afterwards, pour the peaches into a baking dish and place in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes.</p>
        <li><p>As the peaches bake, in another large bowl, combine your measured flour, the rest of your white and brown sugar, baking powder, and salt.After combining, Blend in your butter with your fingertips until mixture is coarse. Finially, stir in your hot water until just combined. **This is your crust or topping to your cobbler**</p></li>
        <li><p>Your peaches shoukd be done and you can remove them from the oven. After removal, drop spponfuls of your crust mixture onto the peaches.
